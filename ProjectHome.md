## Hello there! ##

This is where we'll be storing the programming source code for our robot that will be entered into the 2014 International Autonomous Robotics Competition (iARoC - "I Rock"). We'll also be using this project's wiki to both make general announcements & to store info about the robot and the issue tracker for discussing the code and other things.

Instructions for setting up your Windows system are up now. Please see the featured wiki pages on the left side of the page.
