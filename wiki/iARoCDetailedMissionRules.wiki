=Overview=
This section will cover the challenges the robots the teams can participate in to earn points and be rewarded at the end of the competition.

===The robot challenges are:===
  # Recover Data
  # Survey Route
  # Claim Mineral Resources

===The team challenges are:===
  # Technical Briefing
  # Public Relations

==Team Schedules==
Each team will pick the start time of each challenge, except Claim Mineral Resources. The sign up will be done at registration and in a linear fashion. Only the Team Captain and Team Mentor are required for this sign up. The team is responsible to show up at their selected start time. During Recover Data allowances will be made on each run after the initial start time to accommodate the Technical Briefing or the Public Relations schedules. In other words, after your first run you may go to the Technical Briefing or the Public Relations and come back to run the second time in the Recover Data.

==Debug Runs==
Teams will be given time on the first day to make debug runs for the purpose of working out last minute bugs and handle any possible unexpected surprises. There will be a sign up sheet available during registration. Each slot will provide for 20 minutes of testing time. You can only sign up for one time slot.

Good sportsmanship has been demonstrated in past iARoCs and teams were very nice in sharing portions of the arena with other teams. The committee understands that this is a good use of everyone’s time and will continue this good behaviour. If a team needs a full run of the maze then the team NOT signed up for that time period must give way to the team which has signed up. In other words, share but be respectful to the team who has control of the maze for that time slot.

==Arena Environment==
The robot challenge arena will be made of 7.62 centimeter diameter white PVC in 61 centimeter sections between joints. All measurements are approximate.

The surface of the arena will be commercial grade carpet of a tight weave and is not subject to change by the committee. The condition of the carpet cannot be changed but the committee will try and address any areas of concern prior to the running of any challenge.

The lighting of the arena is florescence and with outdoor natural light. All efforts will be made to prevent direct sunlight in the arena. Indirect light from the outside will not be constrained due to the public nature of the event. The doors will not be blocked and people will be permitted in and out of the arena viewing area.

Every effort will be made by the Judges and Wranglers to ensure the conditions of the arena do not affect the running of the robots. Some conditions may not be in control of the competition organizers such as heating, cooling, light, darkness, humidity and other environmental factors. Any requests must be made prior to the start of the Challenge for ALL teams.

==Scoring==
Winners will be determined based upon the points earned in each challenge. Please see the section below the table for detailed description of each challenge. Each team will only get one score per challenge based upon the column.

=Robot Challenges=

==Recover Data==

*Objective:* Test the ability of the robot to travel at a high rate of speed in a straight line and maintain a minimum distance from the lane walls.

*Overview:* Teams will be paired and run through a double elimination format to allow for a random mixing of teams to compete against each other. Each team will have an opportunity for 3 speed runs to get their best time. A robot must cross the finish line to have its time recorded or it will be counted as no time. There will be no moving obstacles during this challenge.

The speed lane will have a start and a stop line. The width will be 3 cells, approximately 2 meters wide, and the robot will start behind the “starting line” and be centered between the lane walls. The centering of the robot behind the starting line is mandatory. The team member has to be ready for the signal to start the robot. The robot must start upon the signal. Unlike competitions in the past the PVC pipe joiners will be pointed inward to give a built in obstacle for wall huggers or wall skimmers. The joiners mandate approximately 10 centimeters distance from the lane wall. The drawing below is a sketch and not the actual dimensions of a lane.

*Scheduling:* The teams will schedule their first race start time during registration at the beginning of the competition. Subsequent start times will be determined via the double elimination but every attempt will be made not to interfere with other challenges going on at the same time therefore subsequent races may be delayed or rearranged if there is a conflict.

*Time Limits:* The race itself is not time consuming but the transition between teams does take time. Initially 10 minutes will be allowed between the initial race schedulings. The Challenge Judge has the leeway to decrease this time to keep the challenge interesting and on track.

*Scoring:* Points are specified in Table 1. First, second and third place points will be awarded to the three teams with the minimum completion times. Completion points will be award to robots which make it across the finish line. Participation points will be awarded for robots that make it across the starting line.  If a team is unable to make its initial selected time the challenge points will be forfeit.
 
==Survey Route==
*Objective:* Test the ability of the robot to solve a simple maze and transverse the maze along the solution path at least once within the time limits of the challenge.

*Overview:*  The intent of this challenge is to have the robot solve for, and navigate, the one direct path to the end point. The maze will be static and standard.  The robot can run the maze as many times as the team desires, within the time limits. Though it is not a rule, in general the first run to reach the end point would be the “mapping” run and the next run in which the robot takes no wrong turns would be the “solution” run. It is reinforced here that the intent of this challenge is for the robot and its on board systems be able to solve the maze problem and navigate the solution path. No remote control, no remote processing, and no manual map data entry is allowed during the Survey Route.

The Team Captain will inform the Lane Judge when the robot is ready to begin a mapping run. During the mapping run the robot may take any number of pathways to the final cell. The Lane Judge will monitor the robot along the mapping run to determine how the robot “learned” the maze. The robot must enter and cross the centerpoint of the final cell by more than 50% of the robot’s body length. It is not required but recommended that the robot touch the final wall of the final cell to conclude the run. The Team Captain and the Lane Judge must communicate during this critical time as the robot may need human contact to tell it that the mapping run has been completed.
 
The Team Captain will inform the Lane Judge when the robot is ready to begin a solution run. During the solution run the Lane Judge will mark the number of wrong turns made by the robot. A wrong turn is defined as where the robot enters a cell off the one solution path by more than 50% of its body length. If a robot goes down a wrong path each new cell along the wrong path is counted as a wrong turn. When the robot completes the solution run the robot must indicate success in some way, such as stopping on its own accord; but a robot victory dance is also okay. Once again, the robot must enter and cross the centerpoint of the final cell by more than 50% of the robot’s body length. It is not required but recommended that the robot touch the final wall of the final cell to conclude the run. When the robot indicates that the robot has completed the solution run the Lane Judge will tally the number of wrong turns.

The Team Captain must inform the Lane Judge to abort a solution run, or a mapping run, in order to start the run again.

The approximate dimensions of the maze lane will be 3 meter by 8 meter. The starting line will be at one end of the maze and the finish line will be at the other end with an infrared beacon. The beacon will be attached to a wall of the maze with a mechanical switch that must be activated to successfully finish the task, a Lane Judge will be on hand in case the switch does not work. The beacon will not be visible from the starting line, as the walls of the maze may obscure the beacon until such point as the robot reaches the correct corridor. There will be no moving obstacles during this challenge.

*Scheduling:* The teams will schedule their start time during registration at the beginning of the competition. A team may finish early but the start time for the next team will NOT be adjusted.

*Time Limits:* The maximum time is specified in Table 1. The robot may continue beyond the time limit if ALL of the following conditions are met:
  # The robot is on the solution run NOT the mapping run.
  # The robot has crossed into the designated cells which indicates the robot has completed 75% or more of the linear length of the maze.

*Scoring:* Points are specified in Table 1 with the following clarifications. Participation points will be awarded for robots that make it out of the starting cell. Completion points will be award to robots which make it to the final cell, i.e. the mapping run. Any number of teams will be awarded the points if the robot navigates the one path of the maze solution, the solution run.  If a team is unable to make its selected time the challenge points will be forfeit. *The human programming of the maze solution (coordinates obtained from a human solution) will disqualify the team from the Survey Route.*

During the solution run, if there were no wrong turns the team will receive the First Place score. If one wrong turn is made the team will receive the Second Place score and if 2 wrong turns are made the team will receive the Third Place score.

==Claim Mineral Resources==
*Objective:* Test the ability of the robot to home in on an infrared beacon in open space with static obstacles and with other moving robots.

*Overview:* The open desert of Mars is strewn with rocks and other obstacles. In this challenge the robot will need to travel through an open arena in order to reach one of 3 infrared beacons. The approximate dimensions of the arena are 8m x 8m. The starting line will be at one end, and the beacons will be located towards the other side but not on the outside wall. This challenge will involve moving obstacles in the form of fellow robot entries. Unlike the Survey Route, where each robot is running solo, in this challenge there will be other robots attempting to achieve the same goal. The robot will be required to work on avoiding the obstacles, rocks and other moving robots, in order to reach a beacon. The beacons, along with the bump switch, will be facing the starting lineup but will also be supported by a freestanding framework. This framework will allow front access to the bump switch. The infrared beacon is a standard Roomba Home Base.

*Scheduling:* This Challenge starts at the same time for all robots but the the start position will be selected by the Team Captain. The selection order will be the reverse of the current standings for all teams.

*Time Limits:* The maximum time is specified in Table 1.
Scoring: The first robot to tap a beacon will receive the 1st place points as specified in Table 1. The next robot to tap the second beacon will receive the 2nd place points as specified in Table 1. And the next robot to tap the third beacon will receive the 3rd place points as specified in Table 1. Team participation points will be awarded to teams that start the Challenge.  If a team is unable to make its selected time the challenge points will be forfeit.

=Team Challenges=

==Technical Briefing==
*Objective:* Communicate the hardware and software design of the robot, specifically exploring the software solutions to the 3 robot challenges.

*Overview:* During the first day of the competition, each team will make a presentation to a panel of judges.

The presentations should include:
  * The overall choice of hardware and software, and the relationship between the hardware and the software
  * Strategies and algorithms for each of the elements of the competition, including how autonomy and learning is implemented
  * Lessons learned and the decision making process: what the team has tried, which has worked, and which issues were found with hard- and software

For the presentation the team may use:
  * Any oral and physical demonstration requiring nothing but the human body
  * Posters and computer presentations with speaking points, diagrams and pictures
  * Hardware, such as robots, circuit boards and tools

The team is responsible for all rhetorical instruments, however a table and a projector with a VGA connector is provided.

The judges are expecting a technical presentation by the entire team explaining the details of the software and hardware engineering of the team’s particular robot, and will specifically be looking for how sophisticated or intelligent the robot is, and why it could be the most capable machine in each of the elements of the competition.

*Scheduling:* The teams will schedule their presentation start time during registration at the beginning of the competition.

*Time Limits:* The time limits are specified in Table 1. When the time limit is reached during the judge’s questions the team must make way for the next team immediately.

*Scoring:* Points are specified in Table 1. The panel of judges will grade each team and award points based upon their grade. The minimum points for a grade is 500 and the maximum is 999. The top 3 teams will be awarded points for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place as specified in Table 1. Each team will only get one score.  If a team is unable to make its selected time the challenge points will be forfeit.

==Public Relations==
*Objective:* Communicate to the general public about the robot competition and specifically about the team’s robot.

*Overview:* During both days of the competition, teams will have the opportunity to showcase their robot to the general public. The team will need to spend their time demonstrating and talking to the public to receive points for the showcase. These informal presentations will be conducted at tables located near the doorway to the Science Center. The team’s robot is required to participate. In addition the team may elect to use poster board or a laptop slideshow to assist in their presentation. Teams must let a Public Relations Judge know that the team has made their robot available for viewing and procure a Public Relations Judge’s signature. The quality of the presentation will not be graded. Teams can make a second presentation and receive additional points.

*Scheduling:* The teams will schedule their presentation start time during registration at the beginning of the competition. The scheduling of the second presentation will be done after all teams have been scheduled.

*Time Limits:* The maximum time is specified in Table 1. Each team has a grace period of 5 minutes during team transitions.

*Scoring:* Points are specified in Table 1. Points will be awarded to the team for participating at the Public Relations as described above.  If a team is unable to make its selected time the challenge points will be forfeit.
