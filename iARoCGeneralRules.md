## Overview ##
The primary objective of this competition is to reward teams which demonstrate the capability of developing a single autonomous robot to perform in various challenges. Not only will the robot have challenges but the team members will also be evaluated.

Each team may use only 1 (one) robot for all challenges and it must autonomous. Changes or modifications to the robot during the competition, in between Challenges, are not allowed. No actuators, sensors, motors, wheels, etc. may be added or removed for individual challenges, in other words the configuration of the robot must be the same for all challenges. A picture of the robot and the team will be taken the day of the registration. Repairs and replacements can be made for damaged or broken parts of a robot as long as these parts do not change the configuration.

## Banners and Posters ##

The issue and circumstances will be taken into consideration and a decision will be made in regard to the issue raised. This ruling will be final. It is iterated here that the competition is focused on the autonomous aspect of the robot and on how the team presented their robot. Issues pertaining to the environment some of which are covered elsewhere, but it accepted that these environmental issues affect all teams equally and should be taken into consideration by the team as part of their solution.
